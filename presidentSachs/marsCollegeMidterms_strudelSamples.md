This is a folder for a sample-pack for use on 230218 for the mars college midterms, for my piece using TTS samples from a fictitious character (President Sachs), generated using TortoiseTTS using the TTS endpoint at examples.eden.art.

This is probably overkill but I don't know which samples I want to use yet, so i'm making them all available.
